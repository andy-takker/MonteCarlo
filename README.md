# MonteCarlo
For the needs of the Department of Economics, I developed the program to calculate the economic efficiency of investment projects (Android app). The program allows predicting the profit of the project based on the Monte Carlo method, calculates the expected NPV and builds the corresponding graphs. The program is patented.
